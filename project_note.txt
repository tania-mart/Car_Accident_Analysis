for index, row in df.iterrow():
	## iterate through the row and get lat nad long
	## use the lat and long to call YELP api
	## use the term "bars" to get the response
	## parse the JSON response
	## count how many bars there are in the response
	## set up a new column "num_bar" that shows the number of bars from the API call


	## still using the lat and long, call the weather API
	## parse the JSON rsponse to get the weather condition on the day of the accident
	## set up a new colum "condition" that shows the weather condition


"preprocessing task"
take a subset (2015)
take antoher subset from 2015 -- take 2

finally, from 2015 data, take random subset of 100




"enrichment task"
don't have to join
call the api -- parse the repsonse for "numenbr of bars" and "weather condition"
set up new columns to df


"analysis task"
analyze the big df: 
see the relationships -- using groupby weather condition
see the relationships -- num_bars vs. severity
see the relatioships -- usign groupby weekend vs. weekday
see the relationships between time of the day vs. severity
