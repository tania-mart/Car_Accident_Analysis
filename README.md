# Car_Accident_Analysis
Data Wrangling Project: Pull and Manipulate the API Data
The point of this exercise is to try data enrichment with data from external APIs. We are going to take data about car crashes in Monroe County, Indiana from 2003 to 2015 and try to figure out the weather during the accident and how many bars there are in the area. We will work with two different APIs during this challenge:

    Yelp API
    World Weather Online API

We will try to find correlations between the severity of crash and weather/number of bars in the area. To indicate the severity of a crash, we will use column Injury Type.
